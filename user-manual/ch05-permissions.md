# Chapter 5 — Permissions

thClaws runs tools on your behalf: it edits files, runs shell commands,
fetches URLs, and invokes MCP servers. **Permissions** decide which of
those happen without your nod.

## Two modes

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `ask` (default) | Mutating / destructive tools prompt for approval before running. Read-only tools run automatically. |
| `auto` | All tools run automatically. Agents can chain edits and bash calls without interruption. |

Set the mode at startup:

```bash
thclaws --cli --permission-mode ask      # explicit
thclaws --cli --accept-all               # alias for --permission-mode auto
```

Or mid-session:

```
❯ /permissions auto
permissions: auto

❯ /permissions ask
permissions: ask
```

## What the prompt looks like

In `ask` mode, when the agent wants to run (say) `Bash`:

```
[tool: Bash: npm install express] ?
 [y] yes   [n] no   [yolo] approve everything for this session
```

- `y` — approve this one call.
- `n` — deny it; the model gets `tool was denied` as the result and
  usually revises its approach.
- `yolo` — flip to `auto` for the rest of the session. The tool
  runs and every subsequent tool call runs without asking.

A `⚠` marker appears alongside commands that look destructive —
`rm -rf`, `sudo`, `curl … | sh`, `dd`, `mkfs`, etc. — so you look
twice before typing `y`.

## Read-only vs mutating defaults

| Read-only (auto in `ask` mode) | Mutating (prompts in `ask` mode) |
|---|---|
| `Ls`, `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep` | `Write`, `Edit` |
| `AskUser`, `EnterPlanMode`, `ExitPlanMode` | `Bash` |
| `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`, `TaskGet`, `TaskList` | `WebFetch`, `WebSearch` |
|   | `Task` (spawn subagent) |
|   | All MCP tools |

The intent: looking at your code is always free; changing your code,
running commands, or reaching the network is a choice.

## Fine-grained allow / deny lists

For project or user config, the `permissions` field in
`.thclaws/settings.json` (or `~/.config/thclaws/settings.json`) accepts
two shapes:

### Simple mode string

```json
{ "permissions": "auto" }
```

### Claude Code-style allow/deny

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Read", "Glob", "Grep", "Write", "Edit", "Bash(*)"],
    "deny":  ["WebFetch"]
  }
}
```

- `allow` entries run without prompting (implicit `auto` for these).
- `deny` entries never run; attempts return an error to the model.
- `Bash(*)` allows all bash commands; `Bash(git *)` restricts the allow
  to git commands only (glob matching on the command string).

The flat form works too:

```json
{
  "permissions": "auto",
  "allowedTools": ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Grep", "Glob"],
  "disallowedTools": ["WebFetch", "WebSearch"]
}
```

## CLI flags for a single run

```bash
thclaws --cli \
  --permission-mode auto \
  --allowed-tools "Read,Write,Edit,Bash" \
  --disallowed-tools "WebFetch"
```

Flags override settings files for that process only.

## The filesystem sandbox {#sandbox-filesystem}

Independent of the permission prompt: **file tools are always scoped to
the working directory.** Paths that escape via `..`, absolute paths
pointing outside, or symlink traversal are rejected before the tool
runs — regardless of permission mode. This is the guard that makes
`yolo` less scary.

If you want the agent to touch something outside the current directory,
either launch thClaws from the parent directory (which widens the
sandbox), or copy / symlink the file in first.

## MCP stdio spawn allowlist

MCP stdio servers are subprocesses spawned from a JSON config file
that may have been cloned from an untrusted repo (`.thclaws/mcp.json`
or similar — see [Chapter 14](ch14-mcp.md)). Because the `command`
field is an arbitrary binary path, thClaws gates every **first-time**
spawn through a separate approval:

```
[mcp] New MCP stdio server wants to spawn:
      name:    filesystem-mcp
      command: npx
      args:    @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /tmp

This will run the binary with your user privileges. Only
approve if you trust the MCP config that requested it.
Approve and remember? [y/N]
```

A yes persists the `command` string into
`~/.config/thclaws/mcp_allowlist.json`; future spawns of the same
command go through without prompting. The allowlist is keyed on the
`command` field only — changing args doesn't re-trigger the prompt,
so be deliberate when approving general-purpose runners like `npx`
or `python`.

**Headless contexts** (CI, GUI with no controlling TTY) fail closed
unless you explicitly set `THCLAWS_MCP_ALLOW_ALL=1` in a trusted
environment. Don't set that var on a shared machine or via a project
`.env` file — the dotenv loader blocks it for exactly that reason.

## Per-agent overrides

Agent Teams and the `Task` sub-agent tool can set their own
`permissionMode` in the agent definition file — useful for letting a
"reviewer" agent run read-only even when the lead is in `auto`. See
Chapter 15 and Chapter 17.
