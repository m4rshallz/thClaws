//! Non-streaming LLM helpers for the research pipeline.
//!
//! Each function below is a single LLM call: build a prompt, drain the
//! `Provider::stream()` for `TextDelta` events into a String, parse,
//! return a typed result. No tool use, no agent loop, no message
//! history — research uses the LLM as a pure callable.
//!
//! The 4 calls per iteration:
//! - [`extract_subtopics`] — query + seed → initial subtopics list
//! - [`extract_next_subtopics`] — query + accumulated + eval notes →
//!   next-round subtopics (close gaps named in notes)
//! - [`evaluate`] — query + accumulated → completeness score (0-1) +
//!   free-form notes
//! - [`synthesize`] — query + accumulated → final markdown with `[N]`
//!   citations + URL list
//!
//! All four are robust to LLM weirdness: if parsing fails, fall back
//! to a sensible default rather than aborting the pipeline. The score
//! parser accepts both `score: 0.7` and `Score: 0.7` (any case) on the
//! first non-empty line; the subtopics parsers accept `1.` or `-` or
//! `*` bullets.
//!
//! Per-call timeout is enforced via `tokio::time::timeout` — provider
//! hangs don't stall the whole pipeline.
